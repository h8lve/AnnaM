        <h2 id="p1">What is Branding?</h2>
        <p>Psychologists believe that emotions have a greater influence on people than they realize. For this reason, companies use different types of tools that affect emotions such as images, stories, voices, or smells. Through this method, companies are able to explain to their consumers why they should purchase a particular product and why they should do so from that specific company.  The messages a company conveys to its consumers through its products and services are referred to as branding.This is the idea of how a company wishes to be perceived by the public. A successful company branding strategy can lead to the product's success in the marketplace.</p>

        <h2>Personal VS Business Brand</h2>
        <p>A personal brand is a reflection of a person's identity, skills and reputation. In contrast, a business brand represents a product and service in the marketplace. In spite of the differences in flexibility, symbolism, and development methods in both keys, strategic branding remains the key to success and overcoming competitors in today's marketplace. Additionally, both work together to grow the community and produce better products and services.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Usually, I use "personal" branding strategies such as skills, job experience, and personality traits to enhance my professional image. I take additional academic courses, read books, travel, and practice as much as possible to improve my professional and personal skills. In this way, I can improve myself and enjoy my time simultaneously. In building my online and offline image, I strive to be as authentic and honest as possible. For me, staying true to one's interests, values, and beliefs is more meaningful than conforming to societal standards. As long as we remain human, "personal" branding becomes more effective for ourselves and those who wish to build relationships with us.</p>
